## Maniac Music Project
> This is the frontend repository for Ava and Alexa Carlson's APCSP project.
- Known as "The Carlson Twins" or "X and V" (thank you Mr. Mortensen), we are a power duo that kind of enjoys computer science.
- This project focuses on music. Users are able to add their favorite songs at the moment and look for concerts, comedy shows, and sports games. Users are also able to log into their Spotify to access what playlists and songs they have.
